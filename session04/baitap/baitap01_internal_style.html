        <strong>Prerequisites:</strong>	Basic software installed, basic knowledge of working with files, and HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML.)
        Objective:	To learn what <strong> CSS </strong>  is.
        In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
